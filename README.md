# SpeechandObjectRecognition
Here , you can find the code I have written for the speech and object detection using python
SO to work with the speech recognition, You first need to install a module associated with python called "SpeechRecognition"
For the module to work, You need to install its dependicies, "PyAudio"
There is a easy way to install it using the Pip, but if you are using windows 10, I would  recommend you to install ".Whl" file and then install it using pip. Download it from here https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio
Now once you are done with installing dependicies, Copy the code and paste it . Run it
